### A showcase of design patterns in C#.

## Behavioral
[Command Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Command)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object that contains all the information about the request, including requests for queues or logs, allowing for much more complex architectures. |

[Strategy Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Strategy)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an object by encapsulating it into different strategies |

## Creational
[Singleton Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Singleton)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. |

[Prototype Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Prototype)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. |

---

## Structural
[Adapter Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Adapter)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. The object that joins these unrelated interface is called an Adapter. |

[Facade Design Pattern](https://github.com/KalebGarrett/DesignPattern/tree/main/DesignPattern.Facade)

| Description |
| ------------- |
| Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework. |
